# Supervision Meeting 2023 May 09
Meeting with Jon and Ebru

## Possible Publication in this year:
**1.VCC Image Analysis case:**\
**Journal?**\
**Main Focus**\
Compare different algorithms; (Alibi-detect; OpenCV) \
Questions: Possible to buy study books and get reimbursed? E-book possible.

**2.SII-Lab digital twin model:**\
Predictive Maintenance experiment;\
Need to get data synchronized;(Protocol, eg, UPC OA)\
Algorithm enhanced!! (The innovation point). 

**3.Paulo's Data-driven Digital twin project, from event log to what-if scenarios**
**Journal co-authorship**\
5 hours per week; till early August.


**4.Preference-based Reinforcement Learning:**\
Possible to publish something ASAP? Since it is the newly published algorithm in 2023; Nobody has done anything in this field with this algorithm. It is very suitable with my study.\
**Journal or Conference?** \
How to choose a proper conference? 

**5.Systematic or Comprehensive Literature Review on what AI have been used on Predictive Maintenance study:**\
Nobody has done this; Also a pre-study; 
**Journal or Conference?** 

**6.Production planning collaboration with Ninan using SII-Lab model** 

**7.AGV routing path optimization with Deep Reinforcement Learning**

**8.Upcoming Scania data in IMAP project**
