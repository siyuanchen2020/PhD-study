Title: Literature review for blockchain-based applications in Maintenance.

Search Query: "Digital Twins" AND "Blockchain" AND (Predictive AND Maintenance). 464 documents found.

Some conclusions from other's literature review: In the context of Industry 4.0 predictive maintenance, researchers have proposed leveraging blockchain technology to achieve data transparency and traceability by storing asset manufacturer data. Sang et al. suggest the use of a blockchain for this purpose, although technical details are not provided. The data stored primarily consists of measurements and control data from the asset manufacturer, excluding production, defect, maintenance, and historical operational data. In another study, Mayer et al. explore real-world manufacturing scenarios and identify use cases for Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs), including subscription models for machines and tools. Their motivation aligns with establishing confidence in the responsible use of rented machines. Similarly, Bai et al. propose the Blockchain-based Platform for IIoT (BPIIoT), targeting a Production-as-a-Service model, where manufacturing owners can provide on-demand services facilitated by smart contracts. The studies emphasize the potential of blockchain in enhancing transparency and efficiency in smart maintenance and manufacturing contexts.

Blockchain technology's potential for Predictive Maintenance: 

* Data Integrity and Traceability: Blockchain can ensure the integrity and immutability of data used in predictive maintenance. By storing maintenance-related data in a decentralized and transparent manner, it becomes resistant to tampering or unauthorized modifications. This helps to establish a reliable and auditable record of maintenance activities, including sensor data, equipment performance, and maintenance logs.

* Secure Data Sharing: Blockchain enables secure and controlled data sharing among stakeholders in the predictive maintenance ecosystem. Through smart contracts, access rights and data permissions can be defined, allowing relevant parties, such as equipment manufacturers, maintenance service providers, and asset owners, to securely access and share necessary data in real-time. This facilitates collaborative decision-making and enhances the accuracy of predictive maintenance models.

* Supply Chain Transparency: With blockchain, the entire supply chain involved in maintenance operations can be made transparent. From equipment manufacturers to maintenance providers and asset owners, each party can record and verify their actions on the blockchain. This transparency helps in tracking the origin, history, and maintenance records of equipment, ensuring compliance, identifying potential issues, and streamlining the supply chain processes.

* Automated Maintenance Execution: Smart contracts in blockchain technology can automate the execution of maintenance tasks based on predefined conditions and triggers. For example, when specific equipment performance metrics or sensor readings deviate from normal thresholds, smart contracts can automatically trigger maintenance actions, such as scheduling inspections, ordering replacement parts, or alerting maintenance teams. This automation reduces response times, minimizes human errors, and improves the overall efficiency of maintenance operations.

* Incentivization and Tokenization: Blockchain-based systems can introduce incentive mechanisms through tokenization. By incentivizing equipment owners, manufacturers, and maintenance providers to contribute data or participate in the maintenance process, blockchain-based platforms can promote data sharing, collaboration, and continuous improvement in predictive maintenance practices.

Previous Study:

* "Energy Saving by Blockchaining Maintenance", published on January 2019. It compares "Conventional  maintenance  strategy  versus  blockchain  based maintenance." 

* "Machine-as-a-Service: Blockchain-based management and maintenance of industrial appliances", published on August 2022.
